<h2>Qualitative</h2>

<p>-I am very detail oriented - I can get tunnel vision.</p>

<h2>Balance in my Passion Projects</h2>
<p>One of my passions is sewing. I like to create stuff for my friends like baby blankets
  and clothes, as well as for myself
  like mending/altering clothing making household items etc.
  I have to use logic to create new patterns and figure out what features I want my project to have, and
  I often have to remake and edit projects to improve functionality. I also like to tailor
  my projects for whoever I am making them for. I made a blanket for my friend's
  daughter that matched her nursery and I made Tree of Gondor bibs for another Lord of the Rings
  nerd's baby.

  growning market where our skills are applicable.</p>
