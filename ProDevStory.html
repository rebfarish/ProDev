<h2>Week 1 Reflection</h2>
  <p>
    We built our first app this week "Fizz Buzz Game" which was super fun! I learned a lot about
    building android apps and I really liked the Android Studio we are using. We
    also started working on a postfix calculator which is more challenging and
    less straight forward then the "Fizz Buzz Game". I also started thining more
    about how I want my personal Android app to function. There has been a lot of
    new information and I feel like I'm doing okay on keeping up. I need to
    continue to study my notes and keep practicing with Java.
  </p>

<h2>Quantitative</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
I have over 15 years experience with foreign language- German.
  </li>
  <li>
I have a 4-year degree in Applied Mathematics.
</li>

<li>
I have been with my partner for over 10 years.
</li>

</ul>

<h2>Qualitative</h2>
<ul>
<li>I am very detail oriented - I can get tunnel vision.</li>
<li>I am very organized - I like things to be perfect/demand a lot from myself.</li>
<li>I am not afraid to speak my mind and be myself - I could be better at active listening.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Balance in my Passion Projects</h2>
<p>One of my passions is sewing. I like to create stuff for my friends like baby blankets
  and clothes, as well as for myself
  like mending/altering clothing making household items etc.
  I have to use logic to create new patterns and figure out what features I want my project to have, and
  I often have to remake and edit projects to improve functionality. I also like to tailor
  my projects for whoever I am making them for. I made a blanket for my friend's
  daughter that matched her nursery and I made Tree of Gondor bibs for another Lord of the Rings
  nerd's baby.
</p>

<h2>Golden Circle</h2>
<p><strong><u>Why</u></strong></p>
  <p>
  I want to own a bussiness with my partner. I want to be my own boss and create my own work.</p>
  <p><strong><u>How</u></strong></p>
    <p>
  coding, math skills, building a client base, adding to my partner's skills, find a niche
  growning market where our skills are applicable.</p>
    <p><strong><u>what</u></strong></p>
    <p>
  design web sites for clients, manage data systems for clients, particularly in the
  geospacial field.
