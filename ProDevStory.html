<p>One of my passions is sewing. I like to create stuff for my friends like baby blankets
  and clothes, as well as for my cats like pet beds and houses as well as for myself

  I have to use logic to create new patterns and figure out what my project really needs, and
  I have to remake and edit projects to improve functionality. I also like to tailor
  my projects for whoever I am making them for. I made a blanket for my friend's
  daughter that matched her nursery and I made Tree of Gondor bibs for another frind's baby.
