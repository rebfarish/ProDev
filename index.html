<h2><strong>Week 4 Assignment</strong></h2>
<h3>Forbidden Island</h3>
<p>We stuck together in order to trade cards easily. We played it pretty safe and took
  a few minor gambles that did pay off. We got really close to winning and if we had
  planned a little bit ahead we would have won. None of us took very large risks, and
  we planned our moves together as a team.
</p>
<p>We talked a little about playing to our strengths. Scott is a really strong coder, 
  Sam is great with graphic design, and I'm hoping that my background in Mathematics
  and data analysis will be useful for us. The game really showed how we we really can 
  work together as a team. I also learned that planning ahead is going to be very
  beneficial for us.

<p>The first photo speaks to where I am right now. I have worked hard these past few
  years to be calm and accepting of situations out of my control, and meditative and focused
  on where I want to go next. The second photo portrays where I want to go. I am working toward a
  major change, I want to do new things, grow and expand myself and my bussiness.

I am pretty difficult to find online. Fortunately my LinkedIn comes up as the second
link when I search for myself. I was unable to find anything else about myself except for
those creepy find people sites. There is another person with my same name whose LinkedIn
and Facebook come up, but nothing negative. I plan to update my LinkedIn throughout
the week to make myself more visible to potential employers.

<h3>Identifying Organizations That I Can Connect With</h3>

<p>I hope to start working on my personal company over the next year while I am
  employed as a software developer. I want to start out as an employee to get some
  more experience as well as build connections to potential clients so I can ultimately
  go the entrepreneurial route.
</p>

<br></br>

<ul>
  <li>Name of potential client: Fractal Foundation
  </li>

  <li>Targeted Contact: Jonathan Wolfe
  </li>

  <li>Contact's information: jonathan@fractalfoundation.org
  </li>

  <li>URL to their website: <a href ="https://fractalfoundation.org/">Fractal Foundation</a>
  </li>

  <li>Why I selected this company: Education in NM is really important to me and I want to inspire
    students to be excited about the STEM field. I met Jonathan at a talk at UNM and he is an amazing person.
    He has worked with thousands of students and is currently the IT Director for UNM's project ECHO
     which helps to empower people to make an impact in their communities.
  </li>

  <li>Strategy for reaching out to this person: I wnat to connect with him on LinkedIn, go to more of his talks
    and speak with him again in person,
    and email him personally about working with the organization.
  </li>
</ul>

<br></br>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>Name of potential client: Desert Hedgehogs/Sneeky Geek Chic
  </li>

  <li>Targeted Contact: Jasmine Frankland
  </li>

  <li>Contact's information: deserthedgehogs@etsy.com
  </li>

  <li>URL to their website:

  <a href= "https://www.etsy.com/shop/DesertHedgehogs">Desert Hedgehogs</a>

<a href= " https://www.etsy.com/shop/SneakyGeekChic">Sneeky Geek Chic</a>
  </li>

  <li>Why I selected this company: Desert Hedgehogs/Sneeky Geek Chic is a local company owned by a freind of mine.
    She has aproached me with frustration about issues with using the Etsy app as a seller,
    especially as she has opened a second shop this year.
    She needs a specific app to help sync her spreadsheets with Etsy. As a small local bussiness,
    this likely would be a job that I would work on in my free time for very little money
    to help out a friend and to gain experince with creating a real working app that I could
     use as an example in my portfolio.
  </li>

  <li>Strategy for reaching out to this person: I already have spoken with her about
    creating this app for her company after the bootcamp.
  </li>
</ul>
  <br></br>

  <ul>
    <li>Name of potential client: Tricore Reference Labratories

    </li>

    <li>URL to their website: <a href = "http://www.tricore.org/home">Tricore Labs</a>
    </li>

    <li>Why I selected this company: I met Kristi Stihel and she was interested in my work in
      the bootcamp. There are a few software development and data analyst postitions at tricore
      that sounded interesting, but also she
      really wanted me to connect back with her after the bootcamp as she may have some other
      potential clients for me.
    </li>

    <li>Strategy for reaching out to this person: I want to connect with her on LinkedIn, as well as
      email her personally after the bootcamp.

<h3>Balance in my Passion Projects</h3>
<p>One of my passions is sewing. I like to create stuff for my friends like baby blankets

  I often have to remake and edit projects to improve functionality. I also like to tailor

  nerd's baby.

<h2><strong>Reflections</strong></h2>
<h3>Week 3</h3>
  <p>
    We started working on our personal Android projects and talked about which capstones
    we are interested in. I am excited to start the capstones. I plan to do a lot of studying
    throughout the week to prepare for exam 1.
  </p>

</p>
<h3>Week 2</h3>
  <p>
    I never expected to get home after an 8 hour day and actually be excited to do my homework!
    I am feeling really good about where I am in the bootcamp so far, this week the idea of object oriented
    programming started to really started coming together for me. I still have a lot to learn and I am
    excited for our personal android apps.
  </p>

<h3>Week 1</h3>
  <p>
    We built our first app this week "Fizz Buzz Game" which was super fun! I learned a lot about
    building android apps and I really liked the Android Studio we are using. We
    also started working on a postfix calculator which is more challenging and
    less straight forward then the "Fizz Buzz Game". I also started thining more
    about how I want my personal Android app to function. There has been a lot of
    new information and I feel like I'm doing okay on keeping up. I need to
    continue to study my notes and keep practicing with Java.
